                        <p><i>Smile</i> and <i>Results</i> are the SovTech Spex which deeply resonates with me. I believe in growth and collaborating with others. I belive in hardwork and constantly learning in order to grow. For example, I have never used the framework React before but I am willing to learn, my first step being creating my static single page application for the first time.</p>
